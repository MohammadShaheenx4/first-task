                    <h3>Q: What should I consider when buying a new car?</h3>
                    <p>A: When buying a new car, consider your budget, the car's fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, safety features, and the reputation of the manufacturer. It's also important to think about your specific needs, such as space, type of driving (city or highway), and additional features like technology and comfort.</p>

                    <h3>Q: How often should I change my car's oil?</h3>
                    <p>A: The frequency of oil changes depends on the type of oil used and the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, it's recommended to change conventional oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, and synthetic oil every 7,500 to 10,000 miles. Always refer to your vehicle's owner's manual for specific guidelines.</p>

                    <h3>Q: What are the advantages of hybrid cars?</h3>
                    <p>A: Hybrid cars combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, offering better fuel efficiency and lower emissions compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars. They are often quieter, have regenerative braking systems, and can reduce overall fuel costs. However, the initial purchase price may be higher, and there may be fewer repair shops familiar with hybrid technology.</p>

                <h2>Maintenance and Safety</h2>
                <article class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: How can I improve my car's fuel efficiency?</h3>
                    <p>A: To improve fuel efficiency, ensure your tires are properly inflated, avoid aggressive driving, reduce excess weight, and follow regular maintenance schedules, including oil changes and air filter replacements. Additionally, try to minimize idling and use cruise control on highways.</p>

                    <h3>Q: What should I do if my car overheats?</h3>
                    <p>A: If your car overheats, pull over safely and turn off the engine immediately. Do not attempt to open the radiator cap while the engine is hot, as it can cause burns. Allow the engine to cool down, then check the coolant level. If necessary, add coolant or water to the radiator. It's best to have your vehicle inspected by a professional to identify the cause of overheating.</p>

                    <h3>Q: How do I know when it's time to replace my tires?</h3>
                    <p>A: Tires should be replaced when the tread depth is below the recommended level (usually 2/32 of an inch). You can check tread depth using a tread depth gauge or a penny test. Additionally, look for signs of wear, such as cracks, bulges, or uneven tread wear. It's also advisable to replace tires every 6 years, regardless of mileage, due to aging rubber.</p>

                <h2>Technology and Features</h2>
                <article class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: What is the difference between AWD and 4WD?</h3>
                    <p>A: All-Wheel Drive (AWD) systems are typically always on, distributing power to all four wheels automatically as needed, and are commonly found in cars and crossover SUVs. Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) systems, often used in off-road and heavy-duty vehicles, can be switched on and off by the driver and provide more power to handle difficult terrain. AWD is ideal for on-road driving in various weather conditions, while 4WD is better for off-road and tough conditions.</p>

                    <h3>Q: What are the benefits of electric cars?</h3>
                    <p>A: Electric cars offer several benefits, including lower operating costs, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a quieter ride. They have fewer moving parts, which can lead to lower maintenance costs. Additionally, electric vehicles (EVs) can be charged at home, providing convenience and cost savings on fuel. However, it's important to consider the range, charging infrastructure, and initial purchase cost when choosing an EV.</p>

                    <h3>Q: What is adaptive cruise control?</h3>
                    <p>A: Adaptive cruise control is an advanced driver assistance system that automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe following distance from the car ahead. It uses sensors and cameras to monitor traffic conditions and can accelerate or brake as needed. This feature enhances convenience and safety, particularly on highways, by reducing the need for constant speed adjustments.</p>
